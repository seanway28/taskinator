# taskinator

Set up the project in GitHub. We'll create a GitHub repository and clone it on our local machine.

Create GitHub issues and development branches. We'll create the GitHub issues that we'll use to track our progress on this project. We'll also create a develop branch and our first feature branch.

Build the HTML and CSS. We'll use HTML and CSS to create the basic Taskinator structure and design.

Create a DOM element. We'll learn about the DOM and create a DOM element for the "Add Task" button.

Capture the button click. We'll observe the user's click of the <button> element and create a response from that click.

Add task items by clicking a button. Finally, we'll add code that allows the user to add tasks to the Tasks To Do list when they click the "Add Task" button.
